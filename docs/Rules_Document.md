Rebalance account procedure: Instructions on how to rebalance a single account. 
        a) Determine which categories should be bought or sold and by how much to reach desired allocation
        b) For all categories that need to be sold, sell the lower of the 'account value for the category' and 'the value needed
            to be sold to reach desired allocation'. -order of account selling doesn't matter
        c) Add up all sales. This amount will need to be bought in the next steps.
        c) Follow the "Ranking starting with best in tax exempt" category list order to determine which categories to buy first. 
            This will concentrate high growth categories in tax exempt and tax deferred account which gives a better tax benefit.
        d) For a buy category, buy the lower of the 'amount needed to reach desired allocation' and 'the amount needed to be 
            bought to reach the total of all sales'.
        e) Iterate through the buy categories using the "Ranking starting with best in tax exempt" list until the total amount 
            sold equals the total amount bought.


Follow this order:

1) If cash on hand + (HSA cash if applicable) is greater than the needed qualified contribution value (
        fund a qualified account with the needed value 
        (IRA is the most likely qualified account be there are other possibilities TBD)


2) If cash on hand is greater than the desired 'Cash/MMKT' allocation value
        fund a non-qualified account with the difference in value ('cash on hand' - desired 'Cash/MMKT' value)
     
      
3) Use rebalance accounts procedure on all 'EXEMPT' accounts. 
        The order of which account is rebalanced does not matter at this time. 
        TBD if order within an tax group will ever matter.         
        SPECIAL RULES: HSA accounts should have ~$5000 cash minimum 
        
        
4) Use rebalance accounts procedure on all 'DEF' accounts. 


5) Use rebalance accounts procedure on all 'NQ' accounts. 
        SPECIAL RULES: Cap the amount of sales across all NQ accounts at the 'Max Taxed Sales' value. 
            This prevents the client from paying too much in tax
            This may prevent the desired allocation from being met, which is ok. 
            

 Note: The 'CASH' accounts should not need to be rebalanced becasue the first two steps move any excess 'cash/MMKT' 
         out of the account and into another tax category. Also, you can't own anything other than 'cash/MMKT' in 
         a 'CASH' accounts. (savings, checking, ext.)
 Note: The 'FIXED' accounts may also prevent the desired allocation from being met, which is ok.
